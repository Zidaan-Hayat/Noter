# Noter

A simple terminal notepad made in python

## Installation

Assuming you have the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Zidaan-Hayat/Noter.git

# Go into the folder
cd Noter/

# Install all the dependencies
python3 -m pip -r install requirements.txt

# Run it
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

The interface is very simple, on the main menu you can press the UP/DOWN or the J/K keys to navigate to your selected entry. The actual interface was **NOT** created by me, go see the amazing work [here (IngoMeyer441/simple-term-menu)](https://github.com/IngoMeyer441/simple-term-menu).
